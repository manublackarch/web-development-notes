# Display and Position Property

# Display Property

- display property specifies the **display behavior of an element**
- it defines how an **HTML element behaves in the layout** - whether it takes full line, allows other elements beside it, or acts like a mix of both

## Display: block

- the **element starts on a new line**
- it takes up **full width of its parent** by default (like from extreme left to extreme right of the viewport width)
- `width` , `height` , `padding` and `margin` can be set
- eg, `<div>` , `<p>` , `<h1>` are by default block elements

## Display: inline

- element does **not starts on new line**
- takes up only **as much width as its content**
- cannot set `width` , `height` and `margin (vertical)`
- eg, `<span>` , `<a>` , `<b>` , `<i>` are inline by default

## Display: inline-block

- inline behavior(**sits next to other elements**) + block behavior(**can set width, height**)
- its perfect for buttons, badges, navigation links, etc
- basically it appear side by side like inline element but have width and height control just like block element

## Common display attributes:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `block` | Forces the element to take full width and start on a new line |
| `inline` | Makes the element fit its content without breaking the line |
| `inline-block` | Behaves like `inline` but allows width/height styling |
| `none` | Hides the element entirely (it doesn’t take space) |
| `flex` | Turns container into a flexbox layout model (modern layout system) |
| `grid` | Turns container into a grid layout model |
| `inline-flex` | Flex layout but inline-level element |
| `inline-grid` | Grid layout but inline-level element |
| `table` | Makes the element behave like an HTML `<table>` |

# Position Property

- position property controls how an element is positioned in the document - whether it flows normally, stick to the viewport, or moves based on its parent
- by default position property is set to static

# Types of Position values:

## 1. static (default)

- it is the **default positioning of all the elements**
- element is **placed in normal document flow**
- `top` , `right` , `bottom` , `left` have no effect

## 2. relative

- element stays in normal flow but it can be moved using `top` , `right` , `bottom` and `left`
- **offset is relative to its original position** (original space of the element remains undisturbed/preserved)
- doesn’t affect other elements
- used like when we want **to nudge/move something without removing it from flow**

## 3. absolute

- element is **removed from normal flow** (no space or gap is preserved of the element which is moved)
- positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (`relative` , `absolute` or `fixed`).
- fully customizable using `top` , `right` , `bottom` , `left`
- used like when we want **full control of where an element goes,** when we want to do **overlapping of elements**
- best practice is to set `display: relative;` of its parent ancestor - like div tag in which the element is placed

## 4. fixed

- removed from normal flow
- **remains fixed at that part of screen** even like when we scroll webpage up or down
- **positioned relative to the web browser window (viewport)**
- its great for headers, navbars, floating buttons
- its always in the same place even on the webpage movement like scrolling, etc

## 5. sticky

- its kind of **hybrid of relative + fixed**
- element acts like relative until a certain scroll position, then it behaves like fixed
- it shows **fixed behavior only when it is in its parent container** and when the **parent container moves from the screen, it also starts moving as relative**
- needs a threshold using `top` , `bottom` , etc

### Fixed vs Sticky:

**fixed remains fixed with respect to viewport of screen, sticky remains fixed with respect to the parent container, like when the parent container moves from UI, sticky element also moves from UI**
