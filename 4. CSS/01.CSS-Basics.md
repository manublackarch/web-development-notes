# CSS Basics

- **Cascading Style Sheets**
- used to style HTML elements by controlling their appearance, layout, colors, fonts, etc.
- **Cascading means** that if multiple rules are applied to any element, the priority is decided based on:
    - **Inline CSS** : it is highest priority
    - **Internal CSS** : its second high (in `<style>` in`<head>` tag)
    - **External CSS** : linked in `.css` file, at third number
    - **Browser default styles** : it is lowest in priority list
- CSS is a rule based language, every CSS rule follows this pattern:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

## Types of CSS:

### 1. Inline CSS

- in this way, CSS is simply written **inside the HTML element using `<style>` tag**
- **highest priority** in cascade order, used for **quick styling of single elements**

```css
<p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is inline styled</p>
```

### 2. Internal CSS

- CSS is written **inside the `<style>` tag** within the HTML `<head>` tag
- mainly used for **styling single page websites**

```css
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: blue;
      font-size: 18px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

### 3. External CSS

- CSS is written in a **separate `.css` file** and linked to the HTML file
- best for large projects with multiple pages
- promotes clean code and reusability
- `.css` file linked in HTML file link inside the `<head>` tag : `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

## CSS Selectors

Selectors are used to target HTML elements for applying styles

### 1. Element Selector

- used to target all HTML elements of a specific type

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

### 2. ID Selector

- targets a specific element with a specific `#idName`
- ID should be unique on page

```css
#intro {
  color: blue;
}
```

### 3. Class Selector

- targets all the elements with same `.class` attribute
- can be used on multiple elements

```css
.note {
  color: green;
}
```

### 4. Group Selector

- applies the same rule to multiple selectors

```css
h1, h2, p {
  font-family: Arial;
}
```
