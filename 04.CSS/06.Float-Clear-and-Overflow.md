# Float, Clear and Overflow

## Float

- it allows elements (mostly images) to **float to either left or right side of their container**
- and other inline **content wraps around it** (like a picture floating at left and a paragraph warped around it)
- used to create multi-column layouts, floating sidebars or navbars and wrapping text around images

```css
img {
  float: left; /* or right */
}
```

## Clear

- its used after floated items
- stops an element from wrapping around floating siblings
- forces the element to move below the floated elements
- basically like first image is floating at the sides of second image, and we donâ€™t want that first image to be present in certain direction of our second image, then we will use clear property in second image to move the first image below the second image

```css
div {
  clear: both; /* or left / right */
}
```

- `clear:both;` is the most common used as it clears images from both the side

## Overflow

- its used to control what happens if content overflows the boundaries of its parent container
- its used to control floated children
- adding `overflow:auto;` to the parent automatically wraps floated children and prevents parent collapse
- by default overflow is visible that leads content spill out
- we can set `overflow:hidden;` to simply cut off content that overflows

```css
.container {
  overflow: auto; /* or hidden / scroll / visible */
}
```
