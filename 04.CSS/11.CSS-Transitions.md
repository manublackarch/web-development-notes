# CSS Transitions

- transitions in CSS allow us to **animate changes between two states of a property** (like color, size, position, opacity) over time
- it is triggered by interaction like hover, click, focus, etc
- it does not requires `@keyframes`
- best for quick, smooth effects like hover buttons, cards, dropdowns, toggles

## Transition Property Breakdown:

### 1. transition-property

- used to define **which CSS property to animate**

```css
transition-property: background-color;
```

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | Animates **all** transitionable properties |
| `property-name` | e.g., `width`, `opacity`, `transform`, `color`, etc. |
| multiple values | comma-separated list |

### 2. transition-duration

- how **long the transition** should take
- **duration should be set, or nothing will animate**

```css
transition-duration: 0.4s;
transition-duration: 0.3s, 0.8s;   /*to set multiple durations  */
```

### 3. transition-timing-function

- controls the speed/pace of the transition

```css
transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
```

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `linear` | Constant speed |
| `ease` (default) | Slow start and end |
| `ease-in` | Slow start, fast end |
| `ease-out` | Fast start, slow end |
| `ease-in-out` | Smooth both ends |
| `steps(n)` | Discrete frame-like steps |
| `cubic-bezier()` | Fully custom curve |

### 4. transition-delay

- time need to **wait before starting the transition**
- useful for staggered animations or sequencing

```css
transition-delay: 0.2s;
```

## Transition (shorthand to apply all properties)

```css
transition: transform 0.4s ease-in-out 0.1s;
transition: property duration timing-function delay;

/*can also be used*/
transition: all 0.3s ease;
```

## What triggers transition

- transitions happen when a property value changes, usually triggered by pseudo-classes

```css
.box:hover{
            height: 80vh;
            background-color: coral;
        }
```
