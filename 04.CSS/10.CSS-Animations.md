# CSS Animations

- animations in css lets us define **how an element changes** over time using `@keyframes` rules and animation properties
- by this we can **animate transform, opacity, position, scale,** etc
- it’s great for **page entrances, loaders, UI feedback forms, modern interactivity,** etc

## CSS Animation properties:

### 1. animation-name

- it’s the **name we give to the element** to which we want to run animations on using `@keyframes`
- it helps in defining which `@keyframes` block to run

```css
animation-name: slideIn; /*given in element's css property*/

@keyframes slideIn {}  /*name used with keyframes to define element to run animation*/
```

### 2. animation-duration

- it sets **how long animation takes to complete one cycle**
- `animation-duration` always needs to specified or the animation will never play

```css
animation-duration: 2s; /* or 500ms */
```

### 3. animation-iteration-count

- it defines how many times animation runs
- default value is 1, means animation runs only one by default

```css
animation-iteration-count: 3;   /* n times */
animation-iteration-count: infinite;  /*forever loop*/
```

### 4. animation-delay

- time duration to **wait before the animation starts**
- delay only affects the start of animation, not in between transitions

```css
animation-delay: 0.5s;
```

### 5. animation-timing-function

- controls the speed curve of the animation
- it determines how speed will change overtime during the animation is running

```css
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
```

| Value | Use-case |
| --- | --- |
| `linear` | Constant speed (spinners, loaders) |
| `ease` | Default, smooth start/end |
| `ease-in` | Starts slow, ends fast (entrance) |
| `ease-out` | Starts fast, ends slow (exit/fade) |
| `ease-in-out` | Smooth on both ends |
| `steps(n)` | For frame-by-frame sprite animations |
| `cubic-bezier(x, y, x2, y2)` | Custom timing (use tools like [cubic-bezier.com](https://cubic-bezier.com/)) |

### 6. animation-direction

- direction in which animation runs

```css
**animation-direction: normal;**
```

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `normal` | Forward (0% → 100%) |
| `reverse` | Backward (100% → 0%) |
| `alternate` | Forward → backward → forward... |
| `alternate-reverse` | Backward → forward → backward... |

### 7. animation-fill-mode

- controls styles before/after animation runs

```css
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
```

| Value | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `none` | Reverts to original style (default) |
| `forwards` | Keeps the final state (100%) |
| `backwards` | Applies start state (0%) before it starts |
| `both` | Applies both start and end states |

### 8. animation-play-state

- it controls whether animation is playing or paused
- `running` is the by default value

```css
animation-play-state: paused;  /* pauses the animation like when we set in hover state*/
```

## Animation shorthand property

- all the above properties in one line

```css
animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration direction fill-mode play-state;
animation: slideFade 0.8s ease-out 0.2s 1 normal forwards running;
```

## `@keyframes` Rule

- defines the animation sequence
- it determines what kind of animation will be applied to element
- Two ways to apply it:
    1. `from` → `to` syntax
    
    ```css
    @keyframes fade {  /* fade is animation-name of element*/
      from { opacity: 0; }
      to   { opacity: 1; }
    }
    ```
    
    1. % steps (better for multi-stage animation)
    
    ```css
    @keyframes bounce {
      0%   { transform: translateY(0); }
      50%  { transform: translateY(-30px); }
      100% { transform: translateY(0); }
    }
    ```
