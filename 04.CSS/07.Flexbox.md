# Flexbox

- Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a 1-dimensional layout method used to align and distribute space along a row or column, especially when building responsive designs

## Structure of flexbox

- the main box like `<div>` that we want to act as flexbox is called **flex-container,** we can set `<div>` to flex-container by setting property `display:flex;`
- **the children** (the content) inside the flex-container are known as flex-items.
- **main axis** is the by default horizontal axis of the flex-container
    - but if `flex-direction` is changed it can act as vertical axis
- **cross axis** is the by default vertical axis of the flex-container
    - always **acts a perpendicular to main axis**

## flexbox structure (flex-direction: row)

```java
Main Axis (row →)                            

+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                    FLEX CONTAINER (display: flex)           |  ↑
|  +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+              |  |
|  | FLEX ITEM |   | FLEX ITEM |   | FLEX ITEM |              |  |
|  +-----------+   +-----------+   +-----------+              |  |  Cross Axis
|                                                           ↑ |  |  (column ↓)
|      Justify-Content: space-between / center / etc.       | |  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+  ↓
  ↑             ↑             ↑             ↑
flex-start   center       flex-end      (on main axis)
```

### flexbox structure (flex-direction: column)

```java
Cross Axis (row →)                        

+----------------------------+
|    FLEX CONTAINER          | ← main-start
|  +-----------+             |
|  | FLEX ITEM |             |
|  +-----------+             |
|  | FLEX ITEM |             |
|  +-----------+             |
|  | FLEX ITEM |             |
|  +-----------+             |
|                            |
+----------------------------+ ← main-end
           ↓
     align-items: center / start / end (on cross axis)
```

# Flex Container Properties

- `flex-direction:` is used to set direction of flex-items in flex-container
- whenever a container is marked flex, **by default the direction of flex-container is `row` (left to right, horizontal)**
- `row-reverse;` value is use to **reverse the row alignment of flex-items (right to left, horizontal)**
- `column;` value is used to **set direction `column` way (top to bottom, vertical)**
- `column-reverse;` is used to present flex-items **in inverted column way (bottom to top, vertical)**

## Flex wrap

- `flex-wrap:` is used to wrap flex items in flex container
- `nowrap;` value is default that brings all items in 1 line
- `wrap;` items are wrapped to next line if needed
- `wrap-reverse;` same as wrap just in reverse order

## Flex flow (`flex-flow`)

- `flex-flow;` is shorthand property that is used to specify the direction of flex-container as well as its wrapping behavior
- `flex-flow: row wrap;`  first value is of `flex-direction` and second is of `flex-wrap`

## Justify Content (main axis alignment)

- `justify-content:` property allows placing of `flex-items` with respect to main axis
    - To remember if **flex-direction is row,** then the **main axis behaves horizontal**
    - when the **flex-direction is column,** then the **main axis behaves vertical**
- `flex-start;`   aligns flex-items to the start (by default)
- `flex-end;`  aligns to the end
- `center;`   centers all items
- `space-between;`  equal spacing, no gaps at ends
- `space-around;`   equal space around items
- `space-evenly;`   equal space between all and edges

## Align Items (cross axis alignment)

- `align-items:`  property allows placing of `flex-items` with respect to cross axis
- `stretch;` default, it fills items cross axis (`flex-items` will be stretched across page)
- `flex-start;`  aligns items to start of cross axis
- `flex-end;` aligns items to end of cross axis
- `center;` centers all items
- `baseline;` align based on text baseline

## Align Content (multiple row alignment - cross axis)

- `align-content:` this property is used when **we have multiple rows of items** (afcos wrap is enabled)
- `flex-start;` aligns rows to top
- `flex-end;` aligns rows to bottom
- `center;` aligns rows to center
- `space-between;` creates equal spaces between rows
- `stretch;` default, stretches rows to fit screen

# Flex Items properties

## Order

- used **to arrange `flex-items`**
- `order:-1;`  on being assigned at the last item, this will bring last item to the start

## Flex grow

- `flex-grow:` property defines how much space a item will take compared to other items
- `0;` = no growth, by default
- `1+;` = grows relative to siblings
- `2 / 5 / 10;` = any number will grow multiply the speed of other items

## Flex shrink

- `flex-shrink:` it defines how will items shrink if there is not enough space
- useful in responsive webpage
- `0;` = don’t shrink
- `1;` = shrink if needed
- `2 / 5 / 10;` = any number will shrink multiply the speed of other items

## Flex basis

- `flex-basis:` it is used to **determine initial height/width** **before flex-grow/shrink**
- `flex-basis: 200px;` just like we determine normal height and width for boxes

## flex (shorthand)

- shorthand notation to apply `flex-grow` , `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis`
- Syntax to use flex : `flex: flex-grow value flex-shrink value flex-basis value`
- eg. `flex: none;` : 0 0 auto;        `flex: auto;` : 1 1 auto;

## Align self

- this will **override align property of align-items of flex-container**
- used to align single single item in flex-container
- `align-self: flex-end;`  just **as align-items values but only to the single single item in flex-box**
